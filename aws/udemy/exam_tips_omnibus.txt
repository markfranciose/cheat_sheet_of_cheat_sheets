S5L1
- Think of a VPC as a logical datacenter in AWS
- VPCs = IGWs, Virtual Private Gateways, Route Tables, NACLs, subnets,
  security groups.
- 1 Subnet = 1 AZ
- Security Groups are Stateful, NACLs are stateless, eg NACLs have to set
  ingress/egress
- No Transitive Peering.

S5L2
- AWS reserves 5 IP addys on each block.
- Can't have multiple IGWs on a VPC

S5L3
NAT Instances
- When creating a NAT Instance, disable 'Source/Destination Check' on the
  instance
- NAT instances must be in a private subnet	
- There must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT instance.
- The size of the instance determines amount of Netowrk traffic.
- If bottlenecking scale instance up
- You can create high availability w/ Autoscalling Groups, mutiple subets
  across AZs, and scripts to automate failover.
NAT Gateways
- Scale automatically to 10Gbps
- No patching
- No security group maintainence
- Automatically assigned public IP
- Remember to update route tables
- No need to disable Source/Destination Checks
- Different NGs in different AZs to guard against failure
- Failover will happen automatically

S5L4
Default NACL created with the default VPC allows everything 
By default when creating a new NACL (your new VPC), everything is blocked.
Each subnet must be associated with an NACL, if you don't associate one it
will be associated with the default.
A subnet can only be associated with one NACL
A NACL can be associated with many subnets
NACLs go before the Security Groups
NACL rules are evaluated in order, lowest first
NACL - inboud/outbound --> block/allow
NACLs can block IPs, security groups can't

S12L108
Kinesis - consume big data 
        - stream large ammounts of data (feeds, logs) into cloud
Large amounts of data:
        - Redshift for business intelligence
        - EMR for big data processing.
Instance store v EBS
        - instance store is ephemeral, can't be stopped, won't survive host going down.
OpsWorks
        - Orchestration Service that uses Chef
        - Chef = recipies to maintain consistent state of infra
        - 'Chef', 'recipies', 'cook book' = OpsWorks
Elastic Transcoder
        - media transcoder in the cloud
        - settings for popular output formats
        - pay based on minutes used and resolution
SWF Actors:
        - starters: can initiate a workflow
        - deciders: control the flow of activity within a workflow 
        - workers:  carry out tasks
Instance meta-data:
        - curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/metadata on the instance

S12L109 Organizations and Consolidated Billing
        - Organizations:
                - Root -> Org Unit -> AWS Accounts.
                - policies can be applied to the Root, Org Units or to individual accounts
        - Consolidated Billing:
                - Paying Account -> dev (dev spend $)
                                 -> production (prod spend $)
                                 -> back office (back-office spend $)
                - Paying account is independent, can't access resources of other accounts
                - limit of 20 linked accounts for consolidated billing
                + one bill
                + easy to track charges and allocate costs
                + volume pricing discount
                        + rollup of data transfer...etc.
                        + unused reserved instances, used by another account
                        (eg, as long as they are the same type, on-demand instances in another account will be applied to that reserved instance reservation)
                - enable MFA on root account, use strong passwd, only using paying account for billing, no resources
                - CloudTrail is on a per account basis, but can be aggregated into a single bucket in the paying account
