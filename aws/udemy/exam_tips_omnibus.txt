S5L1
- Think of a VPC as a logical datacenter in AWS
- VPCs = IGWs, Virtual Private Gateways, Route Tables, NACLs, subnets,
  security groups.
- 1 Subnet = 1 AZ
- Security Groups are Stateful, NACLs are stateless, eg NACLs have to set
  ingress/egress
- No Transitive Peering.

S5L2
- AWS reserves 5 IP addys on each block.
- Can't have multiple IGWs on a VPC

S5L3
NAT Instances
- When creating a NAT Instance, disable 'Source/Destination Check' on the
  instance
- NAT instances must be in a private subnet	
- There must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT instance.
- The size of the instance determines amount of Netowrk traffic.
- If bottlenecking scale instance up
- You can create high availability w/ Autoscalling Groups, mutiple subets
  across AZs, and scripts to automate failover.
NAT Gateways
- Scale automatically to 10Gbps
- No patching
- No security group maintainence
- Automatically assigned public IP
- Remember to update route tables
- No need to disable Source/Destination Checks
- Different NGs in different AZs to guard against failure
- Failover will happen automatically

S5L4
Default NACL created with the default VPC allows everything 
By default when creating a new NACL (your new VPC), everything is blocked.
Each subnet must be associated with an NACL, if you don't associate one it
will be associated with the default.
A subnet can only be associated with one NACL
A NACL can be associated with many subnets
NACLs go before the Security Groups
NACL rules are evaluated in order, lowest first
NACL - inboud/outbound --> block/allow
NACLs can block IPs, security groups can't
