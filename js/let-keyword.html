		<h2>Let scoping example</h2>
		<h4>Check out the console & the code</h4>

		<p>A let variable declared in a file, or in a separate script
		tag doesn't get block scoped to that file or script. Only if 
		enclosed in an explicit block (around the file, or around some
		scope above the usage) will the let-declared variable not be
		available globally. 

		However, part II, a variable declared with let is NOT a property
		of the global object, so <code>window.letVariable</code> would be
		undefined
		</p>

		<script>
			let letVariable = "I am a variable declared with let."
			var varVariable = "I am a variable declared with var."
			{ 
				let explicitBlockLet = "Help, help, I am enclosed!"
			}
			
		</script>

		<script>
			console.log(letVariable);
			console.log(varVariable);
			try {
				console.log(explicitBlockLet);
			}
			catch(error) {
				console.error("Here is our error")
				console.error(error);
			}
		</script>
			
		<script>
			console.log(window.letVariable);
			console.log(window.varVariable);
		</script>
