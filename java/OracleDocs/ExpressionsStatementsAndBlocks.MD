### Expressions: 

An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators and method invocations which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value.

### Statements:

Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in a natural language. A statement forms a complete unit of execution. The following types of expressions can be made into a statement by terminating the expression with a semi: 
- Assignment expressions
- Use of ++ or -- (incrementing)
- method invocations
- Object creation expressions

Such statements are called expression statements. Some examples: 

// assignment statement
value = 10239.123123; 
// increment statement
value++; 
// method invocation statement
System.out.println("We printin!");
// object creation statement
Bicycle myBike = new Bicycle();

In addition to expression statements there are declaration statements and control flow statements.
A declaration statement declares a variable. 

// declaration statement
double doubleVal = 123908389.22222;

Control flow statements regulate the order in which statements get executed.
