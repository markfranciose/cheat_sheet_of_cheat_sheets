## Background

### Webcrawlers
- Webcrawlers are little programs that visit webpages and attempt to figure out what a website is about and who it would be useful to
- They attempt to remove common words and distill your page into it's most unique form.
- Search engines want to provide users with the information that they want.
- Webcrawlers will 'rate' the usefullness and value of your site.
- This gets very sophisiticated, they have trackers to see how long people stay on the site, much more.
- You want your site to be built in such a way that the webcrawlers will put it where you want it. Both in terms of content and quality.

## Best Practices 

### Recentcy Bias
- Search engines generally perfer newer content to older content.
- Ensure your site is well maintained.
- Remove dead links.

### Don't try to game the Search Engines
- If you think you personally are smarter than the whole of Google, go for it. 
- Elsewise, don't get cute.
- Tricks get found out and you get severly dinged in your rating.


## Tools

### Google Keyword Planner
- Able to see relevant keywords from basic to specific.
- See the volume of searches for the specific term.
- Search and sort by the $ it would cost to place ads for those words.
- Look for keywords that are relevant to your business, but with low competition (these provide the highest value).
- think 'what are the relevant words to my business that fewer people are fighting for'

### Google Trends
- Pretty self explanatory what its providing.
- See how certain search terms are trending.
- Narrow down relevance geographically.
- Neat feature: look at other relevant clusters of keywords.

### Spyfu
- If SEO is important, can look at what other competitors have done
- Piggy back on their research.

## Misc. 

### SPAs
- With a single page app, most web crawlers will run your Javascript, and hopefull get all your content.
- However, they'll only wait a certain amount of time before moving on, so you might only get the HTML that's rendered in 2 seconds. 
- Use server-side rendering to ensure that you get it right.
