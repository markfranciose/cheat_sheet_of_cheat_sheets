1. create the db
	- create a password for the SYSTEM user (the initial admin/superuser)	
2. Logon as ```SYSTEM```
	- Go to dashboard
	- this will give ```SYSTEM``` the required permissions
3. Create a new user
	- give uname, passwd
	- at bottom, choose permissions for the new user.
(If you click on an area and get a 403 error, your created user is missing the permissions for that feature)

4. logout and login as newly created user.
	- you'll be prompted to change passwd
