associative array: key value pairs data type, each key can appear only once. aka dictionary, map, symbol table.

checksum: A hash function, used to verify data integrity, eg. that it hasn't been corrupted or altered. You compare your data against a published checksum.

firmware: A class of software that provides low-level functionality for a specific piece of hardware.

hash function: Any function that can be used to map data of an aribtrary size to a fixed size.
( cryptographic ) hash function: Above, suitable for crypto. eg. infeasable to reserve/invert.

hash table: implements an associative array data structure to map keys to values. ideally, each key gets a unique bucket. rather than search through whatever the number of items, just hash the input and go to that location.

node: data point within a larger sturcture.

tree: heiarchical data structure with a root value, and subtree of parents w/ children nodes linked together.
