Use Univeral to have an app run in native on both ipad and iphone
w/o universal -- app will run in an iphone-emulator like-state
XCode -> Target -> deployment


errors: 
Invalid Bundle. iPad Multitasking support requires these orientations: 'UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait,UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown,UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft,UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight'. Found 'UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait,UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown' in bundle 'com.bitscoffee.PhotoMarks.iOS'.
solution: --> iPad Multitasking support requires all the orientations but your app does not, so you need to opt out of it, just add the UIRequiresFullScreen key to your Xcode projectâ€™s Info.plist file and apply the Boolean value YES.

find your UUID
ituens -> plug in device -> click on serial number -> UUID will pop up
