load balancing - efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, aka server farm or server pool. 

modern high-traffic websites must serve hundres of thousand, if not millions of concurrent requests from users or clients and return their stuff in a fast and reliable manner. To cost-effectively scale to meet these high volumes, modern cimputing best pratice generally requires adding more servers. 
A load balancer acts as the "traffic cop" sitting in front of your servers and routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests in a manner that maximuzes speed and capacity utilization and ensures that no one server is overworked, which would degrade performance. If a single server goes down the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining oncline servers. When a new server is added to the server group the load blancer anutomaticaly starts to send requsts to it. 

In this manner, a load balancer performs the following functions: 
- Distributes client requests or netwoek load efficiently across multiple servers. 
- Ensures high availability and reliability by sending requests only to servers that are online. 
- Provides the flexivility to add or subtract serversa s demand dictates.
